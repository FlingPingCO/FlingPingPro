# How to Test the Production Build

Due to the restrictions in this environment, I wasn't able to directly run the production build command. However, you can test it yourself by following these steps:

## Testing the Build Process

1. In the Replit Shell tab, run:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. If successful, this will create a `dist` directory containing:
   - The compiled frontend assets
   - The bundled server code

3. To verify the build succeeded, you can check for the existence of the dist directory:
   ```bash
   ls -la dist
   ```

4. To test the production build, run:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

5. This will start the application in production mode using the bundled files.

## What to Look For

A successful build will create:
- `dist/index.js` - The bundled server code
- `dist/assets/` - The compiled frontend assets

If there are any issues with the build process, the error messages should provide details on what went wrong.

## Debugging Build Issues

Common issues that might occur:
1. **TypeScript errors**: Fix any type errors in your code
2. **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are installed
3. **Path resolution issues**: Check for incorrect import paths
