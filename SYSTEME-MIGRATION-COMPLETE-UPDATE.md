## Current Architecture

The current architecture of FlingPing.co follows a simplified model:

1. **Frontend**: React-based UI with forms for user interaction
2. **Backend API**: Express server handling form submissions and webhooks
3. **Data Storage**: 
   - In-memory storage for session data
   - Google Sheets integration for long-term data storage
4. **Payment Processing**: Direct Stripe integration

### Integration Flow

```
User → FlingPing.co Frontend → Backend API → Google Sheets
                                          ↘ Stripe (for payments)
```

## Environment Variables

The application now requires the following environment variables:

- `PIPEDREAM_SECURITY_TOKEN` - For webhook validation
- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` - For Google Sheets integration
- `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` - For Google Sheets integration  
- `GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID` - For Google Sheets integration
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - For payment processing
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - For payment processing
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - For Stripe webhook validation

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Simplified Architecture**: 
   - Reduced external dependencies
   - More direct data flow
   - Easier maintenance and troubleshooting

2. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - Eliminated Systeme.io subscription fees
   - Reduced API calls to external services

3. **Better Control**:
   - Full control over form styling and behavior
   - Direct access to all collected data
   - Customizable validation and error handling

4. **Performance Improvements**:
   - Faster form submissions without third-party redirects
   - Reduced latency in data processing

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Hostinger**:
   - Follow the updated deployment guide
   - Configure all required environment variables
   - Verify the deployment using the post-deployment checklist

2. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Watch for any issues after deployment
   - Monitor Google Sheets data collection
   - Ensure webhook endpoints are functioning correctly

3. **Future Enhancements** (Optional):
   - Consider implementing a more robust database solution
   - Add email verification functionality
   - Enhance reporting and analytics capabilities

## Conclusion

The migration away from Systeme.io has been successfully completed. The platform now has a more streamlined architecture with fewer external dependencies, resulting in better performance, security, and cost efficiency. The documentation has been updated to reflect these changes and provide guidance for deployment and maintenance.
