# Systeme.io Webhook Integration Test Report

Date: March 3, 2025

## Overview

This report documents the testing of the Systeme.io webhook integration for FlingPing.co.

## Test Environment

- Local development environment
- Node.js server running on port 5000
- No external integrations configured (Google Sheets, Notion)

## Test Scenarios and Results

### Test 1: Basic Webhook Reception

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"contact_email":"test@example.com", "contact_first_name":"Test", "contact_last_name":"User", "form_name":"Test Form", "form_id":"test123"}' http://localhost:5000/webhook/systeme
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Webhook received successfully",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-03T02:39:28.618Z"
}
```

**Server Logs:**
```
Received Systeme.io webhook payload: {"contact_email":"test@example.com","contact_first_name":"Test","contact_last_name":"User","form_name":"Test Form","form_id":"test123"}
Created new email signup from Systeme.io for: test@example.com
Google Sheets integration not configured, skipping
Notion integration not configured, skipping
```

**Result:** ✅ PASSED
- Webhook endpoint successfully received the data
- Data was parsed correctly
- Email signup was created in the database
- Integration dependencies were properly checked before attempting to use them

### Test 2: Data Storage

**Expected Behavior:**
- Contact data should be stored in the local database

**Observed Behavior:**
- Log shows successful creation of email signup: "Created new email signup from Systeme.io for: test@example.com"

**Result:** ✅ PASSED

### Test 3: Error Handling

**Expected Behavior:**
- System should handle missing third-party integrations gracefully
- Should continue processing even if some steps fail

**Observed Behavior:**
- Logs show proper handling of missing configuration: 
  - "Google Sheets integration not configured, skipping"
  - "Notion integration not configured, skipping"

**Result:** ✅ PASSED

### Test 4: Response Format

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should return 200 status code even if there are non-critical errors
- Response should include success status and timestamp

**Observed Behavior:**
- Returned 200 status code
- Response included success: true and timestamp

**Result:** ✅ PASSED

## Integration with Third-Party Services

The following integrations are implemented but require configuration to be tested:

1. **Google Sheets Integration**
   - Status: Implemented but not configured
   - Required configuration: 
     - GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
     - GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY
     - GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID
     - GOOGLE_SHEET_ID

2. **Notion Integration**
   - Status: Implemented but not configured
   - Required configuration:
     - NOTION_API_KEY
     - NOTION_DATABASE_ID

## Conclusion

The Systeme.io webhook integration is functioning correctly at a basic level. The endpoint successfully:

1. Receives data from Systeme.io
2. Processes the data in the expected format
3. Stores the data in the local database
4. Handles missing third-party integrations gracefully

## Next Steps

1. Configure Google Sheets and Notion integrations for production use
2. Implement more robust error handling and logging
3. Add security features like signature validation
4. Perform testing with actual Systeme.io webhook requests
