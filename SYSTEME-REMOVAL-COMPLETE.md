# FlingPing.co - Systeme.io Removal Complete

This document confirms the complete removal of all Systeme.io integrations from the FlingPing.co website.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
1. Removed all Systeme.io API calls from the codebase
2. Updated webhook endpoints:
   - Renamed `/webhook/systeme` to `/webhook/legacy` for backward compatibility
   - Removed Systeme.io-specific data processing
3. Consolidated webhook security to use `PIPEDREAM_SECURITY_TOKEN` consistently
4. Removed Systeme.io environment variables:
   - `SYSTEME_API_KEY`
   - `SYSTEME_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Frontend Changes
1. Removed all Systeme.io form embeds and redirects
2. Replaced with native forms that connect directly to Google Sheets
3. Updated sign-up flow to use Stripe checkout for payments
4. Added Google Analytics tracking to all pages

### Documentation Updates
1. Created this migration completion document
2. Updated all deployment guides to remove Systeme.io references
3. Added comprehensive deployment documentation for Hostinger

## New Data Flow Architecture

### Contact & Email Sign-ups
1. User submits form on FlingPing.co website
2. Data is sent to backend API (`/api/email-signup` or `/api/contact`)
3. Data is stored in local database
4. Data is sent to Google Sheets via Google API
5. Confirmation is displayed to user

### Payment Processing
1. User clicks "Become a Founding Flinger" button
2. User is directed to Stripe checkout
3. Upon successful payment, user is recorded as a Founding Flinger
4. Payment confirmation is stored in database and Google Sheets

## Verification Steps
1. All forms on the website have been tested and work correctly
2. Google Sheets integration is receiving data from all forms
3. Google Analytics is tracking user interactions
4. All webhook endpoints are functioning as expected
5. No remaining references to Systeme.io in active code

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Google Analytics for user behavior
2. Review Google Sheets data for any issues
3. Continue with Hostinger deployment as planned

## Notes
- The webhook legacy endpoint (`/webhook/legacy`) remains for backward compatibility but no longer sends data to Systeme.io
- All customer data is now managed in Google Sheets and our local database
- For any future integrations, we recommend using the Google Sheets API directly
