# Webhook Integration for FlingPing.co

This document outlines the migration from Pipedream to webhook.site for collecting form data from the FlingPing.co website.

## Overview

FlingPing.co is set up to collect and store form data in two ways:

1. **Primary Storage**: Backend API with in-memory storage (currently working)
2. **Backup Storage**: Webhook integration (in progress)

## Migration from Pipedream to webhook.site

We have removed the Pipedream integration and will be implementing webhook.site instead for the following reasons:

1. **Simpler Setup**: webhook.site provides an instant, zero-configuration endpoint for testing
2. **No Authentication Complexity**: Easy to use for development and testing
3. **Real-time Inspection**: Allows immediate viewing of webhook payloads
4. **Robust Debugging**: Helps identify data format issues quickly

## Current Implementation Status

The status of our webhook implementation is:

1. ✅ **Pipedream removal**: All Pipedream code has been removed from the application
2. ✅ **Primary storage**: Backend API storage is working correctly for all form submissions
3. ⏳ **webhook.site setup**: Need to generate a new webhook URL from webhook.site
4. ⏳ **Code implementation**: Need to implement webhook calls to the new URL

## Forms That Will Use Webhook Integration

1. **Contact Form** (`ContactForm.tsx`)
   - Currently sends name, email, and message to the backend API
   - Will send the same data to webhook.site

2. **Email Signup Form** (`SignupForm.tsx`)
   - Currently sends name and email to the backend API
   - Will send the same data to webhook.site

## Implementation Plan

To implement the webhook.site integration:

1. **Get webhook URL**: Generate a new webhook URL from webhook.site
2. **Update code**: Implement the HTTP requests to send form data
3. **Implement proper error handling**: Ensure non-blocking behavior
4. **Add logging**: Log response status and any errors for debugging
5. **Test thoroughly**: Verify data is being properly received

## Data Format

The data will be sent in the following format for consistency and clarity:

```json
// For email signup form
{
  "form_type": "email_signup",
  "name": "User's Name",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-02T23:59:59Z"
}

// For contact form
{
  "form_type": "contact_form",
  "name": "User's Name",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "message": "The user's message content",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-02T23:59:59Z"
}
```

## Benefits of Using webhook.site

- **Instant Setup**: No configuration or account required
- **Visual Interface**: See all received webhook data in real-time
- **Request Inspection**: Examine headers, payload, and timing
- **Filtering Options**: Filter by source or content
- **Export Capability**: Export data for further analysis

## Next Steps

1. Create a webhook.site endpoint
2. Implement the HTTP requests in the server/routes.ts file
3. Update this documentation with the actual implementation details
4. Test all forms to verify proper data transmission

## User Experience

The application will continue to provide users with personalized messages:

```
"Thank you, [name]! FlingPing.co is happy to have you join the fight for herd awareness. We'll be in touch soon."
```

This personalized approach works reliably with our storage system, ensuring users always receive clear confirmation.
