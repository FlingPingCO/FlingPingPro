# Webhook Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of webhook.site as a data collection endpoint for form submissions on FlingPing.co.

## Integration Details

### Webhook URL
- Production URL: `https://webhook.site/00af6027-a80c-4b5f-bd0e-ce5408f954ed`

### Form Types and Data Structure

1. **Email Signup Form**
   ```json
   {
     "form_type": "email_signup",
     "name": "User's name",
     "email": "user@example.com",
     "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
   }
   ```

2. **Contact Form**
   ```json
   {
     "form_type": "contact_form",
     "name": "User's name",
     "email": "user@example.com",
     "message": "User's message content",
     "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
   }
   ```

### Integration Implementation

The webhook integration is implemented as a non-blocking HTTP request to webhook.site. This means:
- Form submissions are first stored in the application's primary storage system
- A webhook request is then sent to webhook.site as a secondary backup
- Any failures in the webhook request do not affect the user experience or primary data storage
- Detailed logs are maintained for both successful and failed webhook requests

### Error Handling

The webhook implementation includes robust error handling:
- Try/catch blocks to prevent webhook failures from affecting core functionality
- Detailed console logging for monitoring request/response cycles
- Non-blocking request pattern to maintain application performance

### Webhook Security

For enhanced security:
- All requests are sent via HTTPS
- Request data is properly formatted as JSON
- No sensitive user data beyond basic form information is transmitted

## Development Considerations

### Testing the Integration
- Submit test data through both the email signup and contact forms
- Verify data is properly received in the webhook.site dashboard
- Check server logs to confirm successful webhook transmission

### Troubleshooting
- If webhook requests fail, check the webhook URL for validity
- Verify network connectivity to webhook.site
- Inspect server logs for detailed error messages

## Future Enhancements
- Add authentication to webhook requests
- Implement retry logic for failed webhook transmissions
- Create dashboard to view webhook transmission history
