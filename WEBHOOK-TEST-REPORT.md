## Test Conclusions

The webhook.site integration is functioning as expected:

1. ✅ Both form submissions are correctly stored in the primary database
2. ✅ Both form submissions are sent to webhook.site as a secondary backup
3. ✅ The webhook requests are non-blocking, maintaining application performance
4. ✅ Proper error handling prevents webhook failures from affecting core functionality
5. ✅ Detailed logs provide visibility into the webhook request/response cycle

## Recommendations

The webhook.site integration is ready for use in the production environment. To further enhance the implementation, consider:

1. Adding retry logic for failed webhook requests
2. Implementing a monitoring system for webhook transmission status
3. Adding authentication to the webhook requests for enhanced security

## Next Steps

The webhook integration is considered complete and ready for deployment. No further changes are needed at this time.
