Steps in Replit (Your Website)

These steps involve setting up the contact form on your Replit website and ensuring it sends data to Pipedream and handles the response appropriately.

    Initial Setup of the Contact Form (Previously Done in Replit):
        Where: In your Replit project, in the files index.html, style.css, and script.js.
        What You Did:
            index.html: Created a form with fields for name, email, and message.
            style.css: Added styling for the form.
            script.js: Added JavaScript to send the form data to the Pipedream webhook URL (https://eod9jvlvbo6511m.m.pipedream.net) using a fetch request.
        Purpose: This sets up the front-end of your website to collect form submissions and send them to Pipedream.
    Update script.js to Handle the Custom HTTP Response (This Is the Step 1 You Asked About):
        Where: In your Replit project, specifically in the script.js file.
        What to Do: In the latest step, we customized the HTTP Response action in Pipedream to return a JSON response:
        json

{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Thank you! Your submission has been received."
}
To make use of this response, you need to update script.js in Replit to parse the response and display the message to the user.
How to Update script.js:

    Open your Replit project (e.g., at https://replit.com/@your-username/MyWebsite).

    Open the script.js file in the Replit editor.

    Replace the existing code in script.js with the updated version below, which parses the JSON response from Pipedream:
    javascript

document.getElementById("contactForm").addEventListener("submit", async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevent the form from refreshing the page

  // Get form data
  const formData = {
    name: document.getElementById("name").value,
    email: document.getElementById("email").value,
    message: document.getElementById("message").value,
  };

  // Display a "Submitting..." message
  const formMessage = document.getElementById("formMessage");
  formMessage.textContent = "Submitting...";
  formMessage.style.color = "black";

  try {
    // Send the form data to the Pipedream webhook
    const response = await fetch("https://eod9jvlvbo6511m.m.pipedream.net", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(formData),
    });

    // Parse the response body
    const responseData = await response.json();

    if (response.ok) {
      // Display the message from the response
      formMessage.textContent = responseData.message || "Thank you! Your submission has been received.";
      formMessage.style.color = "green";
      document.getElementById("contactForm").reset(); // Clear the form
    } else {
      // Display an error message
      formMessage.textContent = responseData.message || "There was an error submitting the form. Please try again.";
      formMessage.style.color = "red";
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle network or parsing errors
    console.error("Error:", error);
    formMessage.textContent = "There was an error submitting the form. Please try again.";
    formMessage.style.color = "red";
  }
});

Where to Enter This: In Replit, in the script.js file. Overwrite the existing code with the above code.

Purpose: This update ensures your Replit form can parse the JSON response ({"status": "success", "message": "Thank you! Your submission has been received."}) sent by Pipedream and display the message field to the user.
