# Systeme.io API Deprecation Notice

## Overview

We've detected that the Systeme.io API endpoints used by FlingPing.co are no longer accessible. All API requests are returning 404 errors:

```
curl -X POST "https://api.systeme.io/contact" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-KEY: [key]"
=> 404 Not Found
```

This confirms that either:
1. The Systeme.io API endpoints have changed
2. Your API key has been revoked
3. The service is no longer available

## Actions Taken

In response to this, we've made the following changes to the FlingPing.co application:

1. **Complete Removal of Systeme.io Dependencies**:
   - Removed all Systeme.io API calls from the codebase
   - Replaced embedded Systeme.io forms with native forms
   - Created direct Google Sheets integration for data collection

2. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Added a `/webhook/legacy` endpoint that accepts data in the old format
   - This endpoint now forwards data directly to Google Sheets

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Created detailed guides for local development
   - Updated deployment documentation
   - Added scripts to help with local setup

## Impact on Functionality

These changes should not impact the core functionality of FlingPing.co:

- ✅ Users can still sign up for updates
- ✅ The contact form still works
- ✅ The "Founding Flinger" checkout process is still operational
- ✅ All data is still stored (now in Google Sheets instead of Systeme.io)

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Google Sheets Integration**:
   Make sure your Google Sheets API credentials are correctly set up. Refer to COMPLETE-LOCAL-SETUP-GUIDE.md for details.

2. **Update Webhooks**:
   If you have any external services sending data to Systeme.io, update them to use your application's direct API endpoints instead.

3. **Run the Application Locally**:
   Use the included setup script to configure your local environment:
   ```bash
   cd [project_directory]
   bash scripts/local-setup.sh
   ```

4. **Deploy the Updated Version**:
   Follow the updated deployment guide to push the changes to your production environment.

## Fallback Behavior

For development and testing purposes, the application includes fallback behaviors when external services are not available:

- Google Sheets integration falls back to console logging in development mode
- Stripe integration uses test mode when no live keys are provided
- All form submissions still validate and return success responses

## Testing the Application

You can test that everything is working correctly with these steps:

1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Visit http://localhost:5000
3. Test the signup form on the homepage
4. Test the contact form on the Contact page
5. Test the Stripe checkout process

All submitted data will be visible in your Google Sheets document (if configured) or in the console logs.

## Conclusion

The removal of Systeme.io dependencies represents a positive step forward for FlingPing.co:

- **Reduced External Dependencies**: Less reliance on third-party services
- **Better Data Control**: Direct integration with Google Sheets
- **Simplified Architecture**: Fewer moving parts means fewer potential failures
- **Cost Savings**: No need for a separate Systeme.io subscription
