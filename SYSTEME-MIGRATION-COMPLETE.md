# Systeme.io Migration Complete

*Date: March 3, 2025*

## Overview

The FlingPing.co platform has been successfully migrated from Systeme.io integration to a fully self-contained solution. This document outlines the changes made and the current state of the platform.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Removed Systeme.io API Integration**
   - Removed all Systeme.io API calls from the codebase
   - Replaced the webhook forwarding with direct Google Sheets integration
   - Updated environment variable requirements

2. **Form Integration**
   - Replaced the Systeme.io iframe with our native signup form
   - Maintained all styling and user experience
   - Streamlined the checkout process with direct Stripe integration

3. **Webhook Security**
   - Updated webhook security to use PIPEDREAM_SECURITY_TOKEN instead of SYSTEME_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing webhook endpoints
   - Enhanced error handling and logging for webhook requests

4. **Data Flow**
   - User signup data now flows directly from our application to:
     - Internal database
     - Google Sheets (when configured)
     - Stripe (for payment processing)
   - Eliminated the middleman service for data processing

## Benefits of the Migration

4. **Enhanced Security**
   - Reduced attack surface by removing third-party integration
   - Better control over data privacy
   - Simplified security audits
